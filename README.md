# AutoMealPlanner
This project is to build an automatic meal planner that can be used by almost anybody. 
The aim of the meal planner is to take the time out of meal prepping and preparing recipes in advance and to ensure complete safety of the client when embarking on health risk diets. 
The end product is designed to be an input &amp; output system.  The user inputs their requirements and specifications based off of the calculations we provide them with originally, the application will then spit out their diet plan with all of the necessary requirements being met. Primary components of the system are the dietary requirements calculation algorithm.  
The client user system, the meal planner itself and the ability to save your meal plan after it is created. 
The application will only be available via the website however the website will be entirely responsive i.e. easy to use on mobile devices.
